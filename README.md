# Frankfurt_memory
A digital wish tree grows in the middle of Frankfurt. People can interact with the tree through their phone. As a participant, you can upload your fish. Or add a memory from a deceased person. An image or a 3d object. Or write something. All will be kept in the tree. And the tree grows as people add to it. Leaves fall in the fall season, on which memories are written.
